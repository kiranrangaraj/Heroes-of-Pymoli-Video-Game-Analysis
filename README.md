## Summary ##

This project uses Python Pandas to analyze data for a fantasy video game called Heroes of Pymoli. The game is free-to-play, like many others in its genre, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. Pandas allows for a breakdown of the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
